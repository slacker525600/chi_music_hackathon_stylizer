============================

trying to use the echonest remix library to modify some songs
things to do going forward ... 
  try to ignore issues. 
    except, fix en-ffmpeg to work with mp3s
    maybe glance at why api key gets dropped on submit... probably a python goodie where somebody doesnt think about a reference... it happens
  subclass the modify class to actually get the kind of edits I want. 
  if I bang my head to hard against a wall... search for a different library / methodology
  set up dynamic html pages to modify a folder as opposed to a list. ... 
    sort of working towards that, but not there
  save feature after processing one song, dont do it again. 
  check if timbre methodology actually makes sense...
