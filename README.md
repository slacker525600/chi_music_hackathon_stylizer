============================

trying to use the echonest remix library to modify some songs
... 
currently things are a bit broken, I reorganized some folders when I got home from the hackathon to ... well better organize
trying to make it a little less hacky. 
hopefully I will get a modify subclass built to do the timbre things I wanted to do earlier
currently reorganizing. 
next thing Im trying to get done is to get the fade function from audio working. 
not sure who uses the remix library but it seems a bit buggy. not sure if its my install / linux setup or what
but I will also be trying to resolve some of those issues if I can, not that I can push them to the echonest, but whatever.
