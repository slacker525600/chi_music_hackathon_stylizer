============================

trying to use the echonest remix library to modify some songs
things to do going forward ... 
  try to ignore issues. 
    except, fix en-ffmpeg to work with mp3s
    maybe glance at why api key gets dropped on submit... probably a python goodie where somebody doesnt think about a reference... it happens
  subclass the modify class to actually get the kind of edits I want. 
  if I bang my head to hard against a wall... search for a different library / methodology
    want to be able to use the remix library to modify existing songs, 
     can take sound data from samples as broken down by remix, but modify does not edit songs the way I want. 
     can use remix modify package to put two samples together, which is a fairly powerful thing, 
       and if I can get sample information I can do most of the editing I want, I think, but Im not certain. 
        ie still investigating. ... but it will be more like, here is the timbre I want to get to
         .. and then modifying/replacing the sounddata ... requires investigating. 
  set up dynamic html pages to modify a folder as opposed to a list. ... 
    sort of working towards that, but not there
  save feature after processing one song, dont do it again. 
  check if timbre methodology actually makes sense...
